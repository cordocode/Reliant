Messages and roles
In the chat completions API, you create prompts by providing an array of messages that contain instructions for the model. Each message can have a different role, which influences how the model might interpret the input.

Role	Description	Usage example
user	
Instructions that request some output from the model. Similar to messages you'd type in ChatGPT as an end user.

Pass your end-user's message to the model.


Write a haiku about programming.
developer	
Instructions to the model that are prioritized ahead of user messages, following chain of command. Previously called the system prompt.

Describe how the model should generally behave and respond.


You are a helpful assistant
that answers programming
questions in the style of a
southern belle from the
southeast United States.
Now, any response to a user message should have a southern belle personality and tone.

assistant	
A message generated by the model, perhaps in a previous generation request (see the "Conversations" section below).

Provide examples to the model for how it should respond to the current request.

For example, to get a model to respond correctly to knock-knock jokes, you might provide a full back-and-forth dialogue of a knock-knock joke.
