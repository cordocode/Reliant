Subject: Required Grease Trap Maintenance Documentation
Dear [Tenant Name],
As specified in your Lease Agreement's Rules and Regulations, you are required to maintain, monitor, and empty the grease trap associated with your restaurant or food preparation business at your own expense.
We are writing to request critical documentation to verify proper maintenance. Specifically, we need you to provide a copy of your most recent quarterly grease trap service manifest. This documentation must be:

Completed by a licensed, insured, and certified contractor
Dated within the last quarter
Clearly showing service details for the premises at [Tenant Address]

Proper grease trap maintenance is crucial to prevent serious potential issues, including:

Significant plumbing blockages
Potential restaurant operations disruptions
Risk of costly flood damage

Your last recorded service was on [Last Service Date]. Please submit the updated manifest within 10 business days of receiving this notice.
Failure to provide documentation may result in the landlord taking necessary actions as outlined in your lease agreement.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this important matter.
Sincerely,

Reliant Property Management
