Subject: HVAC Maintenance Contract 

Dear [Tenant Name],

As outlined in the lease [lease section], we're reaching out about your HVAC maintenance contract for the property at [Tenant Address]. We know, exciting stuff, right?

We aim to keep things running smoothly behind the scenes. Our approach is straightforward:
- We track contract details to stay ahead of maintenance needs
- We'll check in every six months if we don't have a clear contract expiration date
- If we don't receive the contract within 15 days, our maintenance team might need to get involved
- This could include a 10% service fee

Our motivation is simple: these HVAC systems are a significant investment, and we want to help you avoid unexpected breakdowns or costly replacements.

The previous record we had on file showed your contract expiring on [Previous Contract Expiration Date]. In the absence of a clear expiration date, we will continue to send automated requests every 6 months to ensure we maintain up-to-date documentation. Please send your most recent contract and we will update our records.

Thanks for your help,

Relaint Property Management
